# 👨‍💻 My AI/ML Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is my personal roadmap as I learn and build skills to become an **AI/ML Engineer**.  
I'm focusing on Python, data science, machine learning, deep learning, and real-world projects — step by step.

---

## 🚦 Phase 1: Get Comfortable with Python 🐍

Before jumping into ML or AI, I need to make sure my Python skills are solid.

- [x] Understand variables, data types, and operators
- [x] Write if/else conditions and loops
- [x] Create and use functions
- [x] Play with lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- [x] Learn how to handle files (read/write)
- [ ] Handle errors with try/except
- [ ] Use built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, `lambda`
- [x] Work with modules and packages
- [x] Use pip and virtual environments for managing projects

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Learn OOP in Python 💡

OOP helps me write cleaner, more organized code — and it's everywhere in ML libraries.

- [x] Create classes and objects
- [x] Understand `__init__()` and `self`
- [x] Use inheritance and method overriding
- [ ] Learn about encapsulation and abstraction
- [x] Try out `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`
- [x] Explore magic methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.

## 📊 Phase 3: Data Science Essentials

Now I’ll dive into tools that help work with real-world data.

### 🧮 NumPy
- [x] Create and manipulate arrays
- [x] Do fast math operations (vectorization)
- [x] Reshape and slice data

### 📋 Pandas
- [x] Use DataFrames and Series
- [x] Read CSV/Excel files
- [x] Filter, group, and clean data
- [x] Handle missing values

### 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn
- [x] Create line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots
- [x] Make heatmaps and boxplots
- [x] Customize visuals for storytelling

## 🤖 Phase 4: Machine Learning Foundations

Now the fun begins — teaching machines to learn from data!

- [x] Understand Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
- [x] Split data into train/test sets
- [x] Build models like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-NN
  - Decision Trees / Random Forests
  - - SVM
  - Naive Bayes

- [x] Evaluate model performance:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC

- [ ] Save and load models using `pickle` or `joblib`
- [ ] Try deploying a simple ML model using Flask or FastAPI

---

## 🧠 Phase 5: Deep Learning & Neural Networks

Time to go deeper and build intelligent systems.

- [ ] Understand how neural networks work
  - Neurons, weights, biases, activation functions
- [ ] Learn about forward/backward propagation
- [ ] Build basic neural nets using:
  - TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch later)
- [ ] Work with:
  - Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNN)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTMs, GRUs
- [ ] Learn about:
  - Transfer Learning
  - Autoencoders

---

## 🔬 Phase 6: AI Specializations

Time to explore deeper areas in AI.

### 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- [ ] Clean and tokenize text
- [ ] Use embeddings (Word2Vec, TF-IDF)
- [ ] Build a sentiment analysis model
- [ ] Learn the basics of transformers

### 🖼️ Computer Vision
- [ ] Preprocess images
- [ ] Classify images (cats vs dogs, etc.)
- [ ] Understand object detection (YOLO, RCNN)
- [ ] Try image segmentation (U-Net)

### 🎮 Reinforcement Learning (just basics for now)
- [ ] Understand agents, environments, rewards
- [ ] Explore Q-learning and Deep Q Networks

## 💼 Phase 7: Projects & Portfolio

Applying what I learn to real-world problems.

- [ ] Titanic Survival Prediction (ML)
- [ ] House Price Prediction (Regression)
- [ ] Handwritten Digit Classifier (CNN - MNIST)
- [ ] Email Spam Detector (NLP)
- [ ] E-commerce Dashboard (Pandas + Seaborn)
- [ ] Deploy ML model with Flask or FastAPI
