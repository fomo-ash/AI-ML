# 👨‍💻 My AI/ML Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is my personal roadmap as I learn and build skills to become an **AI/ML Engineer**.  
I'm focusing on Python, data science, machine learning, deep learning, and real-world projects — step by step.

## 🚦 Phase 1: Get Comfortable with Python 🐍

Before jumping into ML or AI, I need to make sure my Python skills are solid.

- [x] Understand variables, data types, and operators
- [x] Write if/else conditions and loops
- [x] Create and use functions
- [x] Play with lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- [ ] Learn how to handle files (read/write)
- [ ] Handle errors with try/except
- [ ] Use built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, `lambda`
- [ ] Work with modules and packages
- [ ] Use pip and virtual environments for managing projects

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Learn OOP in Python 💡

OOP helps me write cleaner, more organized code — and it's everywhere in ML libraries.

- [ ] Create classes and objects
- [ ] Understand `__init__()` and `self`
- [ ] Use inheritance and method overriding
- [ ] Learn about encapsulation and abstraction
- [ ] Try out `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`
- [ ] Explore magic methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.

## 📊 Phase 3: Data Science Essentials

Now I’ll dive into tools that help work with real-world data.

### 🧮 NumPy
- [ ] Create and manipulate arrays
- [ ] Do fast math operations (vectorization)
- [ ] Reshape and slice data

### 📋 Pandas
- [ ] Use DataFrames and Series
- [ ] Read CSV/Excel files
- [ ] Filter, group, and clean data
- [ ] Handle missing values

### 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn
- [ ] Create line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots
- [ ] Make heatmaps and boxplots
- [ ] Customize visuals for storytelling

## 🤖 Phase 4: Machine Learning Foundations

Now the fun begins — teaching machines to learn from data!

- [ ] Understand Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
- [ ] Split data into train/test sets
- [ ] Build models like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-NN
  - Decision Trees / Random Forests
